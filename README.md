# FatedBans
The system is banned from being on the server in Gmod for the [SAM admin system](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/sam).

## Configuring the addon
To configure it, you just need to go to the file in the `lua/fatedbans/config.lua` directory and change the required parameters. 

*I recommend that you set up the jobs to issue and remove the ban before starting the server*
